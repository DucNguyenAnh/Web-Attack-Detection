# WEB ATTACK DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING

## Overview
This project is capable of detecting web attacks based on HTTP packet patterns using NLP model

## Features

- The model uses multiple HTTP packet samples collected from the web server through the HTTP Debugger
- The model analyzes each word in the packet and gives a suspicious rate based on a set threshold.
- The model can make instant predictions so it can be integrated as WAF


Some examples of model recognition:
